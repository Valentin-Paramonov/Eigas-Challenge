Eiga's Challenge
=================
###Greetings, Stranger!
You think you're worthy enough to be called a true Exception-Wielder?
Let's see if you can put your confidence where your mouth is!
I, Great Eiga, have prepared a challenge for you to take on.

The challenge  consists of five rounds. Each round will test your knowledge about Java Exceptions.
Complete all of them and you'll get to know something new about yourself; Fail and be laughed upon through the rest of y our miserable life!

Still want to proceed? Well then, open the command line and type in
```
./gradlew challenge
``` 
or
```
gradlew.bat challenge
```
depending on your platform.

  Let the challenge begin!

1. Round One

  In this round you need to prove that you're even worthy to be considered for the challenge. Calculate the incalculable or run away while you still can, kid!

2. Round Two

  In this round you need to help Guido the Keymaker to make a key for you to pass onward! Looks like he's having a problem...Do you have what it takes to carry on?

3. Round Three

  In this round you have to defeat the Beastly Dragon! He's got the answer, can you get it out of him?

4. Round Four

  In this round you have to kiss the sleeping beauty, maybe she has the answer? But beware, there's an ugly witch around here somewhere!

5. Round Five
 
  This is the final challenge! Never thought you would get this far. Jokes on me! Welp, none of that matters, since you will never get through this one, kid! Dive into the Dark Abyss and emerge with the answer, or never emerge at all! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Cough, cough, cough...
